# About This Site

The FOSS Foundation metadata directory is both a stable listing of a subset of interesting FOSS Foundations and related data, as well as an active development project adding new metadata, new foundations and other entities listed, and is looking for input on what else is useful for you, the reader!

In particular, we are hoping to be a core resource of metadata about organizations in the open source space to both foundation leaders as well as researchers around the world.  So your ideas and help are welcomed.  In particular, we have a number of [research ideas waiting to be explored](/research).
