Many major open source projects are hosted at some of the key FOSS Foundations, like the ASF, Linux Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy, and more.  These projects aren't individual legal entities, but may follow governance, release, financial, or other policies at their host foundation.

These listings are updated on a best-effort basis, and provide just a snapshot into the kinds of projects that are hosted at just a few foundations out there today. 

- [Apache Software Foundation](projects-asf) projects.
- Linux Foundation projects.
- Eclipse Foundation projects.
- Software Freedom Conservancy projects.
- [NumFocus](projects-numfocus) projects.
- [Software In The Public Interest](projects-spi) projects.

Project listings may not be current.  Various helper scripts in [assets/ruby/scrapers.rb](https://github.com/Punderthings/fossfoundation/tree/main/assets/ruby/scrapers.rb) are used to semi-automate enumerating foundation projects and creating a simplified per-foundation `.csv` listing.
