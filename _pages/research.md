# {{ page.title }}

Welcome researchers!  We are actively looking for collaborators to turn this metadata repository into a key resource for research around open source/FOSS related communities, code, and organizations.  Many existing research studies simply consider projects or communities individually, not (as they so often are) part of a larger community or foundation with specific IP, trademark, development, or community processes or expectations.  This is a rich area for research to consider when looking at outcomes along any axis of FOSS project trajectories.

## New Research Methods - Organizational Impacts

Most studies on FOSS product outcomes or community trajectories focus on specific projects individually, perhaps bucketing populations by some discoverable variable based on individual GitHub repos.  This style of research misses a vast amount of key variables related to higher level organizations within the FOSS ecosystem.  Using this FOSS Foundation metadata to subset research populations opens up entirely new lines of comparative research around governance style, community ethos, IP & trademark policies, and use of CLAs vs DCO or other inbound licensing schemes.

### Current Metadata Available

While the current Foundation directory only includes a subset of all FOSS-related nonprofit organizations, it does cover the vast majority of US and EU hosting organizations that affect FOSS projects directly.  The existing dataset covers each of the major project hosts in the ASF, LF, Software Freedom Conservancy, NumFOCUS, SPI, Inc., and a number of language- or distro-specific foundations.

- What aspects of Foundations affect projects the most?  We currently cover IP policy basics, Code Of Conduct listings (or not), board size and governance factors, and a variety of sponsorship and budget data.
- Are there cultural norms at host Foundations that change project outcomes, or are differences in Foundations more easily quantifiable like by license choice or the like?
- How can we discover other key Foundation factors that might impact projects?
- What common factors are there in non-Foundation hosted projects (i.e. independent projects) that make them different from Foundation-hosted projects?

All of these and many more are new fields for researchers to explore!  Let us know your interests and how we can collaborate on data design and storage for these factors.

## Site-Specific Research Needs

FOSS Foundations are not the only organizations that matter in the software ecosystem.  Here are a few other areas we're interested in researching.  This is an open source project that [relies on contributors like you](https://github.com/Punderthings/fossfoundation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help!
