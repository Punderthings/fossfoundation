## How to Suggest Changes

Substantiative changes, or changes to **descriptions** of specific FOSS Foundations should either be made by a GitHub user clearly associated with that Foundation's board or officers, or should include a comment pointing to a link on that Foundation's site validating the change.  Factual data about organizations is simple to verify with a link; however I want to be sure that each organization's officers can have a say in any descriptive text presented here about their Foundation.

If you have: :question:

-  a question or see a problem, please open a GitHub Issue with a detailed description.
-  a specific suggestion or improvement, please open a GitHub Pull Request with the change.
-  a larger change to propose or new idea, please open a GitHub Issue to **start** a discussion before doing more work.

Reminder: Please be [excellent to each other](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
