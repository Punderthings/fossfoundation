The Open Collective Foundation used to provide nonprofit status + fundraising + money management software to aligned groups.  However, the [OCF has announced they are terminating operations](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-collective-official-statement-ocf-dissolution/) by the end of 2024, so this entry will be left as a historical record.
