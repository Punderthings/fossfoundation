## Code of Conduct for Contributors

This site is run by Shane Curcuru, and is meant as a resource for the world to showcase the many non-profit FOSS Foundations that help keep open source projects and communities running. Contributions are welcomed, and must be licensable under [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Regular contributors are welcome to join as maintainers.

Contributors and participants in the GitHub project infrastructure are expected to be excellent to each :smiley_cat: :dog: other, and in general follow the widely-used [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) ![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)] 

Opening a GitHub Issue detailing any unnaceptable behavior within this project is the preferred way to report problems; however if for any reason you wish to make a report privately, you may email **complete** details of the errant behavior, as well as **why** you believe the behavior is inappropriate, to shane@punderthings.com.  All reports will be treated as confidentially as practical (meaning: if I get a subpoena, I may have to turn over emails).
